        <h3>Road to be an accountant</h3>

          <p>in the beginning, being an accountant was always the main goal for me. Growing up, I was always good with numbers and problem solving. 
            The idea of being an accountant was proposed by my cousin who was an accountant for KPMG, one of the big four accounting firms. </p>

          <p>I started high school by choosing subjects that supported my main focus, being accounting. I studied at University of South Australia and completed my bachelors of Commerce. 
            Throughout my studies, I was told that Accounting is a well-respected profession that comes with high pay. This was one if the main drives for me to pursue Accounting.</p>

        <h3>My accountant career</h3>

          <p>Upon graduating from University, I was thrown into a long gruelling job hunt. 
            So many questions I had to ask myself, 'do I want to be a public or private accountant?', 'Where do I start?', 'Should I aim to study for my accountant certification?', 'Which certification should I chose? CA or CPA?'  
            My downfall was asking all these questions at the end of my degree.
            I really struggled to find my first accounting job. I was contemplating on starting a new degree in anything I.T related, as I was into computer gaming and I was building desktop computers for family and friends. I.T just made sense!</p>

        <h2>"I wish someone told me to start my job search during my early years of studying..."</h2>  
        </quote>

          <p>However, nearly a year after I graduated, I landed my first official accounting job, a Tax Accountant for Income Tax Professionals (I.T.P). This was it! I finally got into the accounting industry! 
            This was my real first hands on experience with tax accounting software and practicing accounting.
            That satisfaction of landing my first accounting job was close to winning the lottery, but this feeling slowly died after my second tax season.
            I always knew accountants usually had to work after-hours, and for a 'new grad' this was normal. The real kicker was that I was only working full-time during tax season (July - October), and two days a week outside of tax season. 
            This was not enough to survive financially. So once I got my year of experience, it was time to move on to the next big accountant role, and I made sure to steer clear away from Tax accounting.</p>

          <p>After my first job as an Tax Accountant, I became an Contracted Financial Accountant for many private companies, one being Drakes Supermarkets. 
            I was exposed to Financial Reporting and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software systems. 
            As a financial accountant, I was heavily working together with the I.T teams to implement new functions within the ERP systems and back-end maintenance at each month end to make sure data was processed correctly according to accounting procedures. 
            I really enjoyed being a financial accountant more than a tax accountant. The long overtime still remained the same, but I was exposed to things outside of accounting, especially working together with the I.T team. 
            However, I was moving from contract work to another contract work, which limited my career progression. 
            I needed to study and obtain my accountant certification for bigger roles, so this was goodbye to contract accountant and hello to being a permanent full-time accountant.</p>

        <h3>The I.T desire</h3>

          <p>Being an accountant for Pernod Ricard Winemakers, was the last and best accountant role! 
            I was processing financial data for a company that had a global presence, with other brand and market companies in over 70 different countries. It felt like I was an accountant for the big guys. 
            This was where I was exposed to a lot of different types of software's to aid with processing financial data as well as providing analytical reporting. 
            I was heavily involved in data analytics, back-end maintenance for cloud-based expense and travel management software solutions, month end maintenance for our ERP system with the Software engineer team. 
            Working with other software engineers made me realise that I have a deeper interest in the data side of accounting rather than the finance side of it.</p>

          <p>With my passion to pursue I.T, I started asking the Software engineers for their advice to start my I.T career and they told me to just jump into the role. 
            Upon hearing this, I applied for multiple Software application roles, even internally. 
            Sadly, I was rejected all for the same reason, the other candidates had a I.T degree and experience in the field. 
            I was then looking for certified educations in Software Engineering to give me a slight edge in the job market. 
            Then the answer appeared before me, a way to get into the I.T industry in a short amount of timeâ€¦ "I.T Boot camps!" </p>

        <h2>"I decided it was time to make a change!"</h2>

        <p>Thus, I gave up on accounting life and took a big leap into Software Engineering with Academy XI.</p>
